# Introduction to Software Convergence

Welcome to the repository for the "Introduction to Software Convergence" course. This repository contains the files and resources for the term project focused on coin analysis programming.

## Project Overview

For the term project, I developed a coin analysis program that utilizes various financial analysis techniques to provide insights and strategies for cryptocurrency trading. The project is divided into two main parts: coin analysis and coin strategy.

## Directory Structure

- **coin_analysis/**: Contains scripts for analyzing coin data using different financial indicators and strategies.
- **coin_strategy/**: Contains scripts for implementing and testing various trading strategies.
- **File/**: Contains the database results generated by running the project.
- **README.md**: The file you are currently reading.

### coin_analysis Directory

This directory contains the following Python scripts for analyzing coin data:

1. **1_bollinger_band.py**: Implements Bollinger Bands for volatility analysis.
2. **2_goldcross_deadcross.py**: Detects Golden Cross and Dead Cross patterns for trend analysis.
3. **3_candle_reader.py**: Reads and interprets candlestick patterns.
4. **4_RSI.py**: Calculates the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for momentum analysis.
5. **5_my_strategy.py**: Custom trading strategy combining various indicators.
6. **write_excel_all_info.py**: Exports all analysis data to an Excel file for further review.

### coin_strategy Directory

This directory contains the following Python scripts for developing and testing trading strategies:

1. **basic_data.py**: Collects and preprocesses basic coin data.
2. **bband.py**: Implements a trading strategy based on Bollinger Bands.
3. **Logistic.py**: Utilizes logistic regression for predicting coin price movements.
4. **morePowerfull_RSI.py**: An enhanced RSI-based trading strategy.
5. **sector_divid.py**: Divides coins into sectors for sector-based analysis.
6. **techical_anal.py**: Performs comprehensive technical analysis.
