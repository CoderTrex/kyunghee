# Game Engine Basic - Doppelganger Game

Welcome to the Doppelganger Game project repository! This project was created using Unreal Engine, with version control managed through SVN. Below, you will find a comprehensive overview of the game, its storyline, gameplay instructions, and additional resources.

## Game Storyline

You have been selected to participate in a doppelganger experiment! Defeat aliens, collect keys, and escape the map. Gather the shining fragments of your identity to recover your memories and complete the game.

## Gameplay Instructions

1. **Collect Keys**: Obtain the key in front of you to unlock the door to the next area.
2. **Gather Identity Fragments**: Collect the shining fragments to help you regain your memory.
3. **Defeat Aliens**:
   - Left Click: Basic attack (damages aliens).
   - Key 2: Launches aliens into the air.
   - Key 3: Slows down aliens (use this frequently if the game becomes too challenging).
4. **Switch Characters**: Use the TAB key to switch between characters.
5. **Follow the Arrows**: Navigate the map by following the arrows.

### Gameplay Tips

- **Arrow Colors**: White arrows indicate the initial player's path, while black arrows indicate the path for the character switched using the TAB key.
- **Key 3 Usage**: Avoid pressing Key 3 repeatedly. Press it at intervals to effectively dodge AI attacks.

## Game Interpretation

The protagonist, originally a comic character, is aware of their fictional nature and desires to live in the real world. The aliens offer to fulfill this wish through a doppelganger experiment. After clearing the map and escaping the aliens, the protagonist becomes a real-world person. Despite losing their memory after the experiment, they instinctively feel the danger of encountering their doppelganger, giving rise to the superstition that meeting a doppelganger means death.

Collecting identity fragments will reveal hints to help you recover your memory:
